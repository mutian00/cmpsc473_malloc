Buddy Alloc.


Add extra parameter to buddy_alloc/slab_alloc that checks if it is possible to accomodate the request - using malloc and free with an int and an int pointer to do it?
^Need some way to quickly determine if the request went through and the returning -1 as a void pointer seems... shady at best
